# python-opencv
Face recognition with Haar-Cascade-Classifier and OpenCV. <br />

<b>Goal is:</b> create a web-based application with facerecognition. Using pre-trained models for recognizing faces (OpenFace and VGG).
<p> First we just create simple Python scripts to demonstrate each part which we want to solve with Python, OpenCV and OpenFace and then integrate each part in the web-based app.</p>

<b>Assumption:</b> Debian/Ubuntu based computer with installed Python 3. How to install Python and the dependencies you can take a look at this https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world and go through it for the first feeling.
